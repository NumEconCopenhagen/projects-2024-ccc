# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **PROJECT TITLE** and is about EXPLAIN.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

Comments and conclusions:

â€‹The graph shows the convergence of human capital per effective worker over time towards a steady state. The blue line represents the actual trajectory of human capital per effective worker "h_t" as it evolves over time. The red dashed line indicates the steady state level, which is the equilibrium point that "h_t" approaches.

Initially, "h_t" starts below the steady state level and increases rapidly, gradually slowing down as it gets closer to the steady state. The graph suggests that as time progresses beyond the 100 time units shown, "h_t" would likely stabilize very close to the steady state level. 


Overall, this kind of analysis is common in economic growth models where it's important to understand how quickly variables like human capital adjust and stabilize in response to changes or shocks.
