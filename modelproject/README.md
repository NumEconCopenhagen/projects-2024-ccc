# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Analysis of the Solow Model with Human Capital** and is about the effects of extending the standard Solow Model to include human capital. We start by defining and analyzing the standard Solow Model analytically and numerically, and then repeat the steps to include human capital. After comparing the two, we have created an interactive plot and explain the effects of an immigration shock.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
