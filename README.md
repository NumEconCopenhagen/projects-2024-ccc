**This repository contains**
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project. We fetch data from Danmarks Statistik through an API. We then go on to compare the analysis made between Danish imports and exports.
3. Model project. We model a Solow Model, where we start with solving the standard Solow Model analytically and numerically. After this, we extend our Solow Model to include human capital, and thus, we compare the two different models. At last, we investigate the effect of a shock to the population on human capital with an interactive plot.
4. Exam project. We solve problems 1, 2 and 3 as according to the enclosed exam assignment.

**Disclaimer on use of AI tools**

As permitted we use AI tools to assist with our Python code throughtout all four projects. It has been common practice for us to use ChatGPT to help contribute to writing the code, and then to read through the code "manually", in order for us adjust it to fit our needs. We have not used AI tools to generate and copy text to use as economic interpretations/explanations or other general understading of graphs etc.
